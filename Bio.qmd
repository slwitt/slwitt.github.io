I am currently a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona studying squash bee foraging behavior in Southern California.

For several years before starting graduate school, my work involved ecological restoration in riparian, tidal saltmarsh, oak woodland, and chaparral ecosystems in the San Francisco Bay Area, including restoration sites with rare and endangered plants. I have led interpretive hikes, and have worked with students (pre-K to college) and volunteers on habitat restoration projects.
