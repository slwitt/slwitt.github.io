    "text": "My research interests involve bee-plant interactions, specifically those involving solitary specialist bees. I am especially interested in how solitary bees are interacting with economically important crops. Squash bees, the main native pollinators of squash, pumpkin, and gourds, have been widely studied, but not much is known about the floral sex preferences of male and female bees visiting squash flowers. For my thesis research, I hope to better understand if squash bee foraging behavior changes seasonally, and if male and female bees have a preference for visiting male or female squash flowers.\n\n\n\nAbove: male squash bee in pumpkin flower"
